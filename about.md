So, how should I start this?

My name is Niccolo-Luise Poblete, or Nico for short.

I was born in the morning hours of May 10, 1991, in Sta. Mesa Heights, in the city of Manila, in the Philippines. I'm a quiet, LA-raised, Southern Californian who's had a love of wanting to make stuff since my youth.

I had a special interest in wanting to make games since I was very little, and I did some stuff around that area, but I didn't think of actually programming games until I stumbled onto [RPG Maker XP](rpgxp) back in late 2005, or early 2006, IIRC. That software had this scripting feature for "advanced users," a library called the [Ruby Game Scripting System, or RGSS](rgss), which used Ruby as its base. Because of my need to control the smallest parts in my creations, naturally, that convinced me to go into computer science and to take up software development as part of my career plan after high school.

The reason why I wanted to make a website was for two reasons: for coding practice, and to actually learn how to make a website.

I'm also an amateur artist and writer (I do not do fanfics, however!) in my spare time (I wrote a random word salad of a story back in 2002, if anyone's interested in looking at that), though I still refer to myself as a student, since I believe it's never too late to learn, or relearn, anything.

My other interests are cooking, fencing, analyzing (and gushing over) media, art, boxing, basketball, social issues, and recently, politics.
