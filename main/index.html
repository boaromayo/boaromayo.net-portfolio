			<p class="paragraph">I finally got my power supply (an AC adapter with a micro USB port) from the mail. I put in the micro SD card with the RetroPie image, plugged the power into the Raspberry Pi that I ordered two weeks ago, and it works!</p>

			<p class="paragraph">I'll have to do a few adjustments in trying to hook the controller and my new wireless keyboard up there, get a few game ROMs (and I have some SNES games I have in mind to put in), and I'll be set!</p>

			<p class="paragraph">I just noticed that I wasn't wearing any green the whole day! I got so distracted playing around on my new RetroPie arcade (and I'll talk more about that tomorrow, hopefully) that that fact slipped past me.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">But, <a href="http://didyouknowblog.com/post/158521168885">according to this fact that I picked up online this morning</a>, the actual St. Patrick didn't wear green either! The idea of green as a color for St. Patrick's Day came about as a color of resistance from the Irish against the British.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">And I think that's all I have to write about for today...</p>

			<p class="paragraph">I'm waiting for the power supply for my Raspberry Pi 3 right now, but it's not coming yet until either tomorrow or Friday.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">*sigh* I wish it was already here so I could get to setting up the Raspberry Pi (a Raspberry Pi 3) that I ordered downstairs...</p>

			<p class="paragraph">The reason why I ordered that $40 board with all of the stuff (the keyboard, the black case, the micro SD card, with the OS I managed to install into it) is so I can actually play old games into it. Let's hope everything goes smoothly after the power supply comes to the front door. It will be long, but it will be done.<br/></p>

			<p class="paragraph">Well, let's see what I can I talk about. Hmmm...maybe I can talk about what I'm doing when I made this website.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">It's Friday, and I'm watching some news about
				peaceful protestors marching onto Ground Zero at Washington D.C. to protest against the DAPL (the Dakota Access PipeLine). There's plenty
				of people down at D.C. there. From the elderly to the very young, of many races, of many colors, of many creeds, of many origins, they're all united as one, fighting for a great cause that's bigger than them.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">It's beautiful. The unity and solidarity between these many groups, they're beautiful.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">That's all I have to say for now.</p>

			<p class="paragraph">The site here's a bit bare bones, but at least I'm proud to claim, for now at least, that this site is not powered by anything but by what I write down here.<br/></p>
