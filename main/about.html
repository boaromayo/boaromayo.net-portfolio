			<p class="paragraph">So, how should I start this?</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">My name is Niccolo-Luise Poblete, or Nico for short.</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">I was born in the early morning hours of May 10, 1991, in Sta. Mesa Heights, in the city of Manila, in a Southeast Asian country called the Philippines. I'm a quiet, LA-raised, Southern Californian man who's had a love of wanting to make stuff since I was young.</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">I had a love for wanting to make games since I was very little, and I did some stuff around that area, but I didn't think of actually programming until I stumbled onto this software called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker_XP" class="rpgxp">RPG Maker XP (or RPG Tsukuru XP)</a> back in late 2005, or early 2006, IIRC. That software had this scripting feature for "advanced users," a library called the <a href="https://rpgmaker.wikia.com/wiki/RGSS" class="rgss">RGSS</a>, which used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language" class="interpreter">interpreted</a> (as opposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language" class="compile">compiled</a>), scripting language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" class="ruby">Ruby</a> as its base, and, because of my need to control the smallest parts in my creations, eventually, it convinced me to go into computer science, and to software development as part of my career after high school.</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">So the reason why I wanted to make a website was for two reasons: for HTML and CSS practice, and to make a professional website without using any preset web templates for help, like Wordpress, Squarespace, or Weebly (though it could be easier to do).</p>
			
			<p class="paragraph">My other interests are cooking, fencing, drawing, analyzing (and gushing over) media, art, boxing, basketball, social issues, and recently, politics.</p>
			
			<!--<p class="paragraph">So why is my website called "boaromayo"? This name is actually a pun on the surname "Borromeo," after Sct. Borromeo, who, along with his other scouts, died in a plane crash while on their way to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_World_Scout_Jamboree">World Scout Jamboree</a> in Marathon, Greece. There are streets in the Philippines named after them.</p>-->
