My gosh, it has been awhile, hasn't it? I'll need to update this website soon...

A few reasons (or excuses) for not posting here are that some bugs have prevented me from updating, namely the pagination features not working properly. Plus, even if there were nothing stopping me from posting, what's next to post? There's too many things to pour out here, or rather, it's becoming tricky to write a good beginning. Procrastination's another.

Currently, I'm learning (or re-learning) plenty of stuff to keep me busy. Languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org), [Go](https://golang.org/) (aka Golang, not to get confused with the game Go), [Swift](https://swift.org/), and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) are on my plate right now, with the help of an app called [SoloLearn](https://sololearn.com/). The latter two I'll need for mobile app development since it has been awhile since I put my mobile app dev muscles to good use. I'm also re-learning Unity and learning Godot, which surprisingly, is a tricky game engine to learn, especially when it comes to implementing player physics.

I'll have to also continue making more sprites for *EoD* soon, since I'm putting that off for too long. My hesitation to continue making pixel art is the looming worry that it'll end up messy, or the trickiness of getting it "right", even though I'm still stuck in the pre-alpha stages... \**grumbles*\*

As for *ur-prinz*, that's going in the back burner indefinitely since I have to continue work on *EoD*. When the time comes to go back to it, I just hope I still remember enough Ruby to put in the features I want to put in...
