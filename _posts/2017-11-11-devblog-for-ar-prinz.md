After reading some blogs on Medium on game development, namely [this one][ad-blog], I decided to make posts for *ar-prinz* just to keep track of my progress so far.

So, how should I start this?

Last night, I managed to complete the lower half of one of my maps:

<img src="/assets/ap-map-2017-11-11.png" alt="ar-prinz-map-1" width="370" height="316" />

I'll probably add some more shrubbery to make it feel a bit more lively. Next phase for that map would be to finish filling in the events there.

I've also done some work on the overworld map. I think that, without spoiling anything, that it's going well so far. I'm deliberating on whether to change it in some areas, and fill up the southern and northeastern ends of that map before calling it passable.

For extra work, I'll set up a webpage for *ar-prinz* here in the near future.
