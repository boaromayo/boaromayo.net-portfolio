Hi, everyone! Sorry for the very long hiatus!

I've renamed the game as *ur-prinz* from *ar-prinz*, worried that I might get this game mixed up with another RPG series, *ar tonelico*.

In other news, I've made a new title screen for the game, the bestiary's working, and I have a splash screen plugin already in place! I've set up a [wiki for the game][wiki] too!

I'll have to do more work on other areas of the game (especially the maps) in the meantime.

For now, here's some screenshots of what I've got so far...
