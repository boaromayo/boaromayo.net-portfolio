I decided to give in and download [RPG MAKER MV][rpgmv] last Thursday, and I'm liking this software! I've already made a few characters and a little face avatar from its character generator! I can say that MV almost captured that same feeling I had when I downloaded the XP version 10, 11 years ago. I just hope this laptop doesn't crash on me (it's already 8 years old now!) the same way the desktop I used to own that had the XP version did. It took **years** to dredge up me and my family's data from the desktop's hard drive!

To be honest, I've been intentionally avoiding MV for a very long time now, since [one of my projects][ar-prinz] that I'm developing right now is using RPG MAKER VX ACE already. I feel like I would be abandoning everything that I worked for (especially the bestiary I'm still working on there) over the past year or two if I transferred my project over. Plus, I have to resize the graphics from VX Ace in order to make it compatible with MV, so there's that snag.

I'll transfer my project there soon as a way to test MV's power. If I like it on MV, that's fine. But, I might keep the VX Ace version lying around and work on the project there.
