I'm waiting for the power supply for my [Raspberry Pi][raspberry-pi] right now, but it's not coming yet until either tomorrow or Friday.

*sigh* I wish it was already here so I could get to setting up the Raspberry Pi (a Raspberry Pi 3B) that I ordered downstairs...

The reason why I ordered that $40 board with all of the stuff (the keyboard, the black case, the micro SD card, with the OS I managed to install into it) is so I can actually play old games into it. Let's hope everything goes smoothly after the power supply comes to the front door. Getting that little computer to work will be hard and long, but it will be done.
