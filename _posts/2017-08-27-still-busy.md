*~sigh~* I'm still trying to put up another website online, and right now, it's now going well...

Whenever I load this site into my local host, it works. But, the problem's coming from it's remote server. For instance, when I go on to the actual website, this is what's being displayed instead of my bare-bones (for now) homepage:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IxIzNY3.jpg" alt="pug-page" width="40%" height="40%" />

For the record, I'm using [Metalsmith][ms], a static site generator, to build my website instead of Jekyll as a way to challenge myself here, with [Pug (which used to be called Jade)][pug] for the site's layout, and Markdown for the entries.

There still might be a way to put the actual site up to [Github-Pages servers][gh-pages] without showing that blank page. So far, thanks to the limited docs available on Metalsmith, and the limited help online, this step is going to be one steep climb.

[gh-pages]: "https://pages.github.com/"
