Looks like I'm going to participate in the 40th Ludum Dare Game Jam (the jam section, but not the compo, more details about that [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules)), which is going to start tomorrow at 6:00 in the afternoon, Pacific!

This is my fourth LD I'm jumping into. For how I'll program this game, I'm thinking of using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)'s library and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), an offshoot of JavaScript, to program this, so this game can be playable online instantly. 

As for the theme, I might use the "start with no resources" and "broken land" themes, making this a survival game, in the most minimalist 2-D way possible.

That's all I have for now! Hope I getting something up and finished!

By the way, my account is [@boaromayo](https://ludumdare.com/compo/author/boaromayo) on Ludum Dare's old blog site, but for the new one, it's [@boaromayox](https://ldjam.com/users/boaromayox).
