Well, let's see what I can I talk about. Hmmm...maybe I can talk about what I'm doing when I made this website.

It's Friday, and I'm watching some news about peaceful protestors marching onto Ground Zero at Washington D.C. to protest against the [DAPL (the Dakota Access Pipeline)][dapl]. There's plenty of people down at D.C. there. From the elderly to the very young, of many races, of many colors, of many creeds, of many origins, they're all united as one, fighting for a great cause that's bigger than them.

It's beautiful. The unity and solidarity between these many diverse groups, they're beautiful.

That's all I have to say for now.
