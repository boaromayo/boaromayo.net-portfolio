I just noticed that I wasn't wearing any green the whole day! I got so distracted playing around on my new [RetroPie][retropie] arcade (and I'll talk more about that tomorrow, hopefully) that that fact slipped right past me.

But, [according to this fact that I picked up online][dyk-blog] this morning, the actual St. Patrick didn't wear green either! The idea of green as a color for St. Patrick's Day came about as a color of resistance from the Irish against the British.

And I think that's all I have to write about for today before I get too political here...
