      <p class="paragraph">Well, let's see what I can I talk about. Hmmm...maybe I can talk about what I'm doing when I made this website.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">It's Friday, and I'm watching some news about
        peaceful protestors marching onto Ground Zero at Washington D.C. to protest against the DAPL (the Dakota Access PipeLine). There's plenty
        of people down at D.C. there. From the elderly to the very young, of many races, of many colors, of many creeds, of many origins, they're all united as one, fighting for a great cause that's bigger than them.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It's beautiful. The unity and solidarity between these many groups, they're beautiful.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That's all I have to say for now.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The site here's a bit bare bones, but at least I'm proud to claim, for now at least, that this site is not powered by anything but by what I write down here.<br/></p>
